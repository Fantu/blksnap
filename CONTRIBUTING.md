## Reporting issues

Report any issue found can help to solve it, many issues can be related to a
specific hardware, software and/or a combination of them and/or
unexpected cases and not always can be spotted by developers, testers and
automatic testing systems.

## Documentation

Documentation is important part for any developer and user to make easy and faster
use the software, testing it, contributing to code etc...
Any contribute, also small can help, there are many thing that need improvements,
the README, the docs describing the project, the features, how to use it, the
kernel documentation, comments in source code etc...

## Testing

Testing is important to have a quality software, see related part in [README](README.md#tests)
and the [README](https://github.com/veeam/blksnap/blob/master/doc/README-upstream-kernel.md) related to upstream kernel integration
for some information.

## Contributing to Source Code

Thanks to contribute of many developers, is possible to
make the software better. Any contribution is useful, even if only small fixes.
In order to have a quality software any code changes should be tested before submit.
