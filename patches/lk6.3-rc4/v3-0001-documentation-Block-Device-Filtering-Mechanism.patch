+================================
+Block Device Filtering Mechanism
+================================
+
+The block device filtering mechanism is an API that allows to attach block
+device filters. Block device filters allow perform additional processing
+for I/O units.
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+The idea of handling I/O units on block devices is not new. Back in the
+2.6 kernel, there was an undocumented possibility of handling I/O units
+by substituting the make_request_fn() function, which belonged to the
+request_queue structure. But no kernel module used this feature, and it
+was eliminated in the 5.10 kernel.
+
+The block device filtering mechanism returns the ability to handle I/O units.
+It is possible to safely attach filter to a block device "on the fly" without
+changing the structure of block devices stack.
+
+It supports attaching one filter to one block device, because there is only
+one filter implementation in the kernel yet.
+See Documentation/block/blksnap.rst.
+
+Design
+======
+
+The block device filtering mechanism provides registration and unregistration
+for filters account. The account contains a pointer to the callback functions
+for the filter. After registering the filter account, filter can be managed
+using block device ioctl BLKFILTER_ATTACH, BLKFILTER_DETACH and BLKFILTER_CTL.
+
+When the filter is attached, the callback function is called for each I/O unit
+for a block device, providing I/O unit filtering. Depending on the result of
+filtering the I/O unit, it can either be passed for subsequent processing by
+the block layer, or skipped.
+
+The filter can be implemented as a loadable module. In this case, module
+unloading is blocked while the filter is attached to at least one of the block
+devices.
+
+Interface description
+=====================
+
+The ioctl BLKFILTER_ATTACH and BLKFILTER_DETACH use structure blkfilter_name.
+It allows to attach a filter to a block device or detach it.
+
+The ioctl BLKFILTER_CTL use structure blkfilter_ctl. It allows to send a
+filter-specific command.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: include/uapi/linux/blk-filter.h
+
+To register in the system, the filter creates its own account, which contains
+callback functions, unique filter name and module owner. This filter account is
+used by the registration functions.
