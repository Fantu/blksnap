Subject: [PATCH v4 00/11] blksnap - block devices snapshots module

Hi all.

I am happy to offer a improved version of the Block Devices Snapshots
Module. It allows to create non-persistent snapshots of any block devices.
The main purpose of such snapshots is to provide backups of block devices.
See more in Documentation/block/blksnap.rst.

The Block Device Filtering Mechanism is added to the block layer. This
allows to attach and detach block device filters to the block layer.
Filters allow to extend the functionality of the block layer.
See more in Documentation/block/blkfilter.rst.

The tool, library and tests for working with blksnap can be found on github.
Link: https://github.com/veeam/blksnap/tree/stable-v2.0

There are few changes in this patch version. The experience of using the
out-of-tree version of the blksnap module on real servers was taken into
account.

Changes:
* Structures for describing the state of chunks are allocated dynamically.
  This reduces memory consumption, since the struct chunk is allocated only
  for those blocks for which the snapshot image state differs from the
  original block device.
* The algorithm for calculating the chunk size depending on the size of the
  block device has been changed. For large block devices, it is now
  possible to allocate a larger number of chunks, and their size is smaller.
* For block devices, a 'filter' file has been added to /sys/block/<device>.
  It displays the name of the filter that is attached to the block device.
* Fixed a problem with the lack of protection against re-adding a block
  device to a snapshot.
* Fixed a bug in the algorithm of allocating the next bio for a chunk.
  This problem was accurred on large disks, for which a chunk consists of
  at least two bio.
* The ownership mechanism of the diff_area structure has been changed.
  This fixed the error of prematurely releasing the diff_area structure
  when destroying the snapshot.
* Documentation corrected.

Thanks to:
* Christoph Hellwig <hch@infradead.org> for his significant contribution
  to the project.
* Donald Buczek <buczek@molgen.mpg.de> for researching the module and
  user-space tool. His fresh look revealed a number of flaw.
* Bagas Sanjaya <bagasdotme@gmail.com> for comments on the documentation.
