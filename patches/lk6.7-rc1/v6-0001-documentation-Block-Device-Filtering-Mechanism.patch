+================================
+Block Device Filtering Mechanism
+================================
+
+The block device filtering mechanism provides the ability to attach block
+device filters. Block device filters allow performing additional processing
+for I/O units.
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+The idea of handling I/O units on block devices is not new. Back in the
+2.6 kernel, there was an undocumented possibility of handling I/O units
+by substituting the make_request_fn() function, which belonged to the
+request_queue structure. But none of the in-tree kernel modules used this
+feature, and it was eliminated in the 5.10 kernel.
+
+The block device filtering mechanism returns the ability to handle I/O units.
+It is possible to safely attach a filter to a block device "on the fly" without
+changing the structure of the block device's stack.
+
+It supports attaching one filter to one block device, because there is only
+one filter implementation in the kernel yet.
+See Documentation/block/blksnap.rst.
+
+Design
+======
+
+The block device filtering mechanism provides registration and unregistration
+for filter operations. The struct blkfilter_operations contains a pointer to
+the callback functions for the filter. After registering the filter operations,
+the filter can be managed using block device ioctls BLKFILTER_ATTACH,
+BLKFILTER_DETACH and BLKFILTER_CTL.
+
+When the filter is attached, the callback function is called for each I/O unit
+for a block device, providing I/O unit filtering. Depending on the result of
+filtering the I/O unit, it can either be passed for subsequent processing by
+the block layer, or skipped.
+
+The filter can be implemented as a loadable module. In this case, the filter
+module cannot be unloaded while the filter is attached to at least one of the
+block devices.
+
+Interface description
+=====================
+
+The ioctl BLKFILTER_ATTACH allows user-space programs to attach a block device
+filter to a block device. The ioctl BLKFILTER_DETACH allows user-space programs
+to detach it. Both ioctls use &struct blkfilter_name. The ioctl BLKFILTER_CTL
+allows user-space programs to send a filter-specific command. It use &struct
+blkfilter_ctl.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: include/uapi/linux/blk-filter.h
+
+To register in the system, the filter uses the &struct blkfilter_operations,
+which contains callback functions, unique filter name and module owner. When
+attaching a filter to a block device, the filter creates a &struct blkfilter.
+The pointer to the &struct blkfilter allows the filter to determine for which
+block device the callback functions are being called.
