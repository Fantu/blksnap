 Blksnap provides the ability to create non-persistent snapshots on
 any block device and keep track of changed blocks.
 It make possible do consistent backup without having to configure (or remake)
 a system with restrictions in the filesystem choice or using LVM

 the blksnap module. The test scripts allow to check the main functions of
 the module. To implement complex test algorithms, ะก++ tests are implemented.
