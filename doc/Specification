This project should implement the task of creating snapshots of block
device for an OS based on the Linux kernel for backup purposes.
On the kernel side, the blk-snap kernel module should be used.

This project should implement:
1. a library in C for managing the blk-snap kernel module;
2. a console program for managing snapshots and other features of the
   blk-snap module;
3. regression tests for checking the main execution branches of the
   console application, the library and the kernel module;
4. scripts for building packages for deb and rpm;
5. documentation.

The blk-snap kernel module should provide the following features:
1. Allows to create snapshots of any block devices of the Linux kernel;
2. Create snapshots simultaneously for several block devices;
3. Track changes on the block devices during the time between the creation
   of snapshots and provide the user level with a map of these changes;
4. Ensure data integrity for the block device even in case of critical
   errors in the operation of the library and the blk-snap kernel module;
5. Allows to use any disk space to store snapshot changes and allows to
   dynamically expand it while holding snapshots of block devices.
